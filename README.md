##OUTLINE FOR TEACHERS
1. Review passing data from a form to a controller.

3. Assign data to an instance variable
4. render the instance variable on a view using erb.
5. .


## Overview

In this walkthrough, we'll show you how to pass data back to views from your controller, and then render it using ERB. This is an important step in building web applications, because it allows us to make your pages *dynamic* rather than *static* - that is, the data can change depending on the inputs provided by the user. As an example, we'll be creating a "String Reverser" - the user inputs a string ("Hello World") and is shown the reverse of the string ("dlroW olleH") on the following page.
